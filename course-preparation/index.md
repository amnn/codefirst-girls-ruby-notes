## Prerequisites

As part of the beginnner's HTML & CSS course, you should already have the following installed on your computer:

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
- [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

You should also have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)

## Installing Ruby

Since Ruby is more a collection of tools than a single program, installing it can be tricky. Railsbridge have some comprehensive [instructions](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/choose_your_operating_system) to follow, depending on your operating system:

### Windows:

- Install Railsinstaller

### Mac (OS X):

- Install XCode's Command Line Tools
- Install Ruby via RVM (up to Railsbridge's step 7)

At the end of it, you should be able to open Terminal/Command Prompt with Ruby on Rails and type:

{% highlight bash %}
ruby -v
{% endhighlight %}

and see something like the following:

{% highlight bash %}
ruby 2.2.0p0 (2014-12-25 revision 49005) [x86_64-darwin13]
{% endhighlight %}

(the exact number you see may be different, but so long as it starts with `ruby 2.`, you're all good!)

## Stuck?

If you get stuck at any point, or something isn't working, please email your instructor, and they should be able to help you. You can also try googling the text of the error you get (a technique used by every programmer!), as someone has probably already encountered it before.

- Install Ruby
- Go through the [Command Line crash course](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) from *Learn Ruby The Hard Way*
- (Optional) If you'd like a taste of what Ruby is like, you can go through some exercises in your browser at [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org/)
