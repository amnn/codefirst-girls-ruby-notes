Today we will be making use of an online exercise book to get comfortable with a few Ruby concepts. Treat this session as a lab, where you learn by doing.

Our goal today is to get through as many of these exercises as possible and to have finished up to and including **Exercise 34 before next week's session**. You will all already be familiar with *Learn Ruby The Hard Way* as you would have had to do up to Exercise 10 for homework. Let's pick up from [Exercise 11](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex11.html)!

### Programming Challenge

If you finish Exercise 34 and want to give yourself a bit of a challenge applying what you've learnt so far, send your instructor an e-mail and let them know you are ready for the challenge. They will send you a problem that you should try and solve on your own.
