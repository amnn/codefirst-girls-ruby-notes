## Deploying

**Heroku** is a platform built for making it easy to deploy your code so that you can solely concentrate on developing your app/website rather than spending time setting up a server yourself. Head over to [heroku.com](https://heroku.com) and sign up for free.

Everything you need for getting your Ruby/Sinatra app deployed on Heroku can be found in [Heroku's documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-ruby-o).
